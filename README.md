# Simple Create React App

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode; Open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to view it in the browser

### `npm test`

Runs tests and outputs code coverage

#### Notes

Locally, the app runs on port 4000 (as specified in the `.env` file)

By default, the app looks to `localhost:3000` for a running API; to override this URL, set `REACT_APP_API_URL` in your environment variables or update `REACT_APP_API_URL` in `.env`
